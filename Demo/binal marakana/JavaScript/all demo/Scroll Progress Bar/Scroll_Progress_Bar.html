            William Windom (1827–1891) was an American politician from Minnesota. He served as a Republican in the United States House of Representatives from 1859 to 1869, and in the United States Senate for three periods between 1870 and 1883. He also served twice as Secretary of the Treasury under three presidents. This line engraving of Windom was produced around 1902 by the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) as part of a BEP presentation album of the first 42 secretaries of the treasury.
